# Avoiding common attacks

Some of the security pitfalls that were considered when designing the system:

+ Using Specific Compiler Pragma **SWC-103**

+ Use Modifiers Only for Validation

+ Pull Over Push (Prioritize receiving contract calls over making contract calls)

+ Re-entrancy **SWC-107**

+ Tx.Origin Authentication **SWC-115**
